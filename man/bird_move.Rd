\description{
Data generated from a hypothetical study of bird movement along a migration
corridor, sampled throughout the year. This dataset consists of simulated
sample records of numbers of observed locations of 100 tagged individuals
each from six species of bird, at ten locations along a latitudinal gradient,
with one observation taken every four weeks. Counts were simulated randomly
for each species in each location and week by creating a species-specific
migration curve that gave the probability of finding an individual of a
given species in a given location, then simulated the distribution of
individuals across sites using a multinomial distribution, and subsampling
that using a binomial distribution to simulation observation error (i.e.
not every bird present at a location would be detected). The data set
(\code{bird_move}) consists of the variables \code{count}, \code{latitude}, \code{week} and
\code{species}.
